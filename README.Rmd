# easyncdf

easyncdf is an `R` package intended to make it easier to work with NetCDF files in `R`. It builds on the functionality in ncdf4 and extends dplyr syntax like `filter` to facilitate familiar reading (and potentially writing) of data from/to NetCDF files.

## Installing

Install like any R package from github:

    library(devtools)
    install_github('potterzot/easyncdf')

## Usage

If your NetCDF file is small enough, you can read the entire thing into a list of tidy data.frames with `read_ncdf(<filename>)`. For larger files or specific variables you can set the bounds of any dimension and the variables you'd like to read in.

## Testing

A test dataset is included in [tests/data/](tests/data). A simple test is to try to read that data into `R` with `read_ncdf("tests/data/test.nc4")`. You can also play around with defining bounds and variables as (very lightly at the moment) done in [tests/testthat/test_easyncdf.R](tests/testthat/test_easyncdf.R).
