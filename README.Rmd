# easyncdf

easyncdf is an `R` package intended to make it easier to work with NetCDF files in `R`. It builds on the functionality in ncdf4 and extends dplyr syntax like `select` to allow familiar reading (and potentially writing) of data from/to NetCDF files.

## Requirements
Some specific software (in addition to R, devtools, and some more common R packages) will help to recreate the results for this paper from scratch. The easiest thing would be to clone this package or to install via `devtools`. If you don't want to do that, you can instead install the following:

**To download raw data:**
* [rnassqs](https://github.com/potterzot/rnassqs)
* [censusapi](https://github.com/hrecht/censusapi)

**To run the analysis:**


## How to use this repository
There are a few different ways you may want to use this repository:

1. To reproduce or examine work and results from the paper.
2. As a base to expand on the research contained herein. If so you may want to just fork the repository and continue on. Contributions to this repository are also welcome! Please follow the contribution guidelines and submit a pull request when ready.
3. As a framework for a [reproducible research]() project. In that case a better alternative might be my [research-template](github.com/potterzot/research-template), which provides a skeleton with some thoughts about the best use. There are several other (and probably better) attempts at this, including [rrrpkg](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg), [projecttemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/), and [cboettig's template](https://github.com/cboettig/template).
3. Use it to access the data used in the project. I haven't worked this out yet, but to the extent possible all data will be made available.
